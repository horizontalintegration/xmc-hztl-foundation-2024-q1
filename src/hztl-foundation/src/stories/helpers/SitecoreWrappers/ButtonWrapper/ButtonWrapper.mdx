# Button Wrapper

## Overview

ButtonWrapper presents an interactive element that triggers a response when initiated by a user. It helps you render the content of its Sitecore field type.

## Usage

ButtonWrapper should be used when you need a mechanism to submit/reset a form, open a dialog/menu, and/or another function as an interface control i.e. previous/next arrows, expand/collapse accordions, etc.

Basically, if you cannot enter a real https:// URL as the href value, you should use ButtonWrapper (over LinkWrapper).

Note: A button does not provide the “Open link in…” options in its context menu (i.e. right click > open new window). If you need these native link features, you should switch to LinkWrapper.
