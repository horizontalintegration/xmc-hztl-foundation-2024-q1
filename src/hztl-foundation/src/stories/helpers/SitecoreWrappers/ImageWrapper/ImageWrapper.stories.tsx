## Overview
The Image Wrapper component is a container for displaying images within a responsive and well-structured layout. It ensures that images are scaled appropriately based on screen size, maintaining aspect ratios and alignment for an optimal visual experience across devices.

## Usage
Use the Image Wrapper when you want to embed images within a layout, such as product visuals, banners, or galleries. It ensures that images remain responsive and retain their quality, while providing options for captions, borders, and other design elements. Ideal for media-heavy pages or sections where image clarity and adaptability are essential.`,
